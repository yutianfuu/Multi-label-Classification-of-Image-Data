# Multi-label Classification of Image Data
### COMP551 Project 
- Developed and trained convolutional neural network-based models to classify the MNIST dataset with handwritten digits and letters. 
- Finally, reached 95.233 percentage of testing accuracy with a VGG16 model predicting digits and a self-developed model predicting letters.
- Semi-supervised learning, noise robustness, and bagging average are used to obtain more powerful and low-variance models.
