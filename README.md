# Multi-label-Classification-of-Image-Data
## COMP551 Project 
## In this project, we developed and trained convolutional neural network-based models to classify the MNIST dataset with handwritten digits and letters. Finally, we reached 95.233 percentage of testing accuracy with a VGG16 model predicting digits and a self-developed model predicting letters. We also attempted semi-supervised learning, noise robustness, and bagging average to obtain more powerful and low-variance models.
